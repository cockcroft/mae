You can download the whole code in various ways, including clicking the link on the left.\r\n\r\n### What is MAE for?\r\nMAE provides a way of controlling and connecting particle accelerator codes, in particular [MAD](http://mad.web.cern.ch/mad/), [Elegant](http://www.aps.anl.gov/Accelerator_Systems_Division/Accelerator_Operations_Physics/oagSoftware.shtml) and [GPT](http://www.pulsar.nl/gpt/). It's a set of Mathematica libraries (really, Packages and Notebooks) that do a lot of the 'heavy lifting' when you want to generate and optimise your accelerator design. It's mainly for high-energy accelerator design, but there is also an interface to GPT for space charge calculations.\r\n\r\n### Who is MAE for?\r\nMAE is not for everyone. There is a learning curve, but it should pay off later on. Eventually there will be proper documentation and a paper on MAE, but for now you should know about these capabilities:\r\n* Generates input files for MAD, Elegant and GPT so they can be more easily compared;\r\n* Brings general simplex, genetic and other optimisers to accelerator design;\r\n* Allows very flexible visualisation of accelerator layout, optics, and particle tracking;\r\n* Makes using the underlying codes easier and more efficient;\r\n* By the way, MAE mostly only works on Windows. If you have a Mac or Linux some of it will still work, we're not sure how much.\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nMAE is being developed by physicists working mainly at the Cockcroft Institute. The lead developer is [James Jones](http://www.stfc.ac.uk/ASTeC/Groups/Accelerator+Physics+Group/Staff/17414.aspx) (STFC Daresbury), with support from [Hywel Owen](http://www.hep.manchester.ac.uk/u/hywel/) (Manchester University), John Jowett (CERN), Peter Williams (STFC Daresbury) and Julian McKenzie (STFC Daresbury).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with MAE? Right now you're on your own, so wait for the documentation or dive in on your own. If you help with development we'll help you right back.\r\n","google":""}
